#Testing React Applications

##Disclaimer
**I never said I was a unit testing genius**


##Part I
###Why bother with unit testing?

###Other ways to catch mistakes
+ Linting
  * JSHint
  * JSLint
+ Static Typechecking
  * TypeScript (Microsoft)
  * Flow (Facebook)

I suggest everyone start using static typechecking. No good reason not too.

###A few unit test frameworks
+ Jasmine
+ Mocha
+ QUnit
+ Tape
+ Jest (Facebook)

###I prefer simpler tools
1000x features and I only use two

###Browser vs headless testing


###Cross Browser testing


###testing with ES6


##Part II
## Testing the simplest component
